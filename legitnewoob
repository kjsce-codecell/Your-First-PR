### How did the camp benefit you ?? 
### >> &ensp; The session helped me to get complete idea about what open source is and how it helps developers by collbarating with other fellow developers. I also learned
on how to make a pull request which was fun. I am planning to implement what I learnt in this session for the HacktoberFest'22.

### Any Suggestions ??
